# Node Server Testing

Guided project for **Node Server Testing** Module.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
- [ ] type `yarn` or `npm i` to download dependencies.
- [ ] type `yarn server` or `npm run server` to start the API.

Please follow along as the instructor add automated tests to the API.

## How to Contribute

- clone the [starter code](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/node-server-testing-guided).
- create a solution branch: `git checkout -b solution`.
- add this repository as a remote: `git remote add solution https://github.com/LambdaSchool/node-server-testing-guided-solution`
- pull from this repository's `master` branch into the `solution` branch in your local folder `git pull solution master:solution --force`.

A this point you should have a `master` branch pointing to the student's repository and a `solution` branch with the latest changes added to the solution repository.

When making changes to the `solution` branch, commit the changes and type `git push solution solution:master` to push them to this repository.

When making changes to the `master` branch, commit the changes and use `git push origin master` to push them to the student's repository.

## Introduce the Module Challenge

Take time to explain what is expected from the [module challenge](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/node-server-testing-challenge), and provide hints about what to test.

## Introduce the Guided Project

Introduce the [guided project](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/node-server-testing-guided).

- fork and clone it.
- install dependencies.
- run it to make sure there are no errors.

## Add .env File to Root Folder

- open `index.js`, note that we're ready to support environment variables.
- add empty `.env`, we'll use it later.

## Change Jest Environment to Node

Explain that `Jest` runs in browser mode using `jsdom`, for server testing we need to change it to run in **node mode**.

- open `package.json` and add:

```json
"jest" : {
  "testEnvironment": "node"
}
```

**restart the server/test if they were running** for the changes to take effect.

## Introduce cross-env

Explain what `cross-env` does in the `test` script inside `package.json`.

- open `./data/dbConfig.js` and show how we're using `DB_ENV` to dynamically load a different `knex` configuration for testing.
- open `knexfile.js` and show we have separate configurations for testing and development.
- open the `data` folder and show that we have separate databases to go with the configurations.

## Pass Environment Flag to Knex Migrations and Seeding

- delete the test database.
- run the command `npx knex migrate:latest --env=testing` and explain how it works in tandem with the configuration defined inside `knexfile.js`.

## Avoid Address in Use Errors When Running Tests

Explain that if the server is defined and started in the same file, it would throw an Address in Use error when running the second test. Having the server separate from the call to `.listen()` avoids that. we're good to go on this.

## Introduce supertest

- introduce [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) and explain what it does.
- add `supertest` as a dev dependency.
- add `./api/server.spec.js`:

```js
// ./api/server.js
const request = require('supertest'); // install this as a dev dependency

const server = require('./server.js');

describe('sever.js', () => {
  // this test helps make sure we're working on the right environment
  it('should set testing environment', () => {
    expect(process.env.DB_ENV).toBe('testing');
  });
});
```

We're going to use `supertest` to test:

- http status code
- format of the data (JSON)
- shape of the response body

## Test that and Endpoint Returns the Correct HTTP Status Code

- add a test for the `GET /` endpoint.

```js
describe('sever.js', () => {
  describe('GET /', () => {
    it('should return 200 OK', () => {
      // explain that we need to return the call to request()
      // this signals to jest that this test is asynchronous and it needs
      // to wait for the promise to resolve, before running the assertions
      return request(server)
        .get('/')
        .then(res => {
          // the response object has useful methods we can use
          expect(res.status).toBe(200);
        });
    });

    // using the squad (async/await) we don't need to return anything
    // jes will wait because of the async function
    it('should return 200 OK using the squad', async () => {
      const res = await request(server).get('/');

      expect(res.status).toBe(200);
    });
  });
});
```

## Test that and Endpoint Returns the Correct Format (JSON)

```js
it('should return JSON', async () => {
  const res = await request(server).get('/');

  expect(res.type).toBe('application/json');
});
```

## Test the Shape of the Response Body

```js
it('should return { api: "up" }', async () => {
  const res = await request(server).get('/');

  expect(res.body).toEqual({ api: 'up' });
});
```

## Write End to End Tests that Involve the Database

Open `./hobbits/hobbitsModel.js`. We'll use **TDD** to implement the data access code.

- open `./hobbits/hobbitsModel.spec.js`.
- add a test for the `insert` method

```js
// we'll use this to verify hobbitsModel is working
const db = require('../data/dbConfig.js');
const Hobbits = require('./hobbitsModel.js');

describe('hobbits model', () => {
  describe('insert()', () => {
    it('should insert the provided hobbits into the db', async () => {
      await Hobbits.insert({ name: 'gaffer' });
      await Hobbits.insert({ name: 'sam' });

      const hobbits = await db('hobbits');
      expect(hobbits).toHaveLength(2);
    });
  });
});
```

Implement code to make the tests pass

```js
// ./hobbits/hobbitsModel.js
async function insert(hobbit) {
  // the second parameter here is of other databases, SQLite returns the id by default
  const [id] = await db('hobbits').insert(hobbit, 'id');

  return db('hobbits')
    .where({ id })
    .first();
}
```

What if the insert is failing and the tests pass because there are other hobbits already in the database? let's add another test.

```js
// note we're checking one hobbit at a time
it('should insert the provided hobbit into the db', async () => {
  let hobbit = await Hobbits.insert({ name: 'gaffer' });
  expect(hobbit.name).toBe('gaffer');

  // note how we're reusing the hobbit variable
  hobbit = await Hobbits.insert({ name: 'sam' });
  expect(hobbit.name).toBe('sam');
});
```

The test passes, but makes the prior test fail because each test is inserting new data into the database.

We can fix that by truncating the _hobbits_ table before running each test.

```js
beforeEach(async () => {
  await db('hobbits').truncate();
});
```

Do another review of how everything works together.

**All inserts target the test database (test.db3)**, running the server will show the data from the `hobbits.db3` database.
